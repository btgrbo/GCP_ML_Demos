- code origin: code developed within partner organization or licensed code used -> Frage an Laurenz: wie ist das mit
    kopiertem code wie zB für best_trial ops
- Evidence must include a certification by the partner organization for either of the above code origin scenarios. In
    addition, if licensed code Is used post-modification, the partner must certify that the code has been modified per
    license specifications.
- describe how you ensure that machine learning projects address the security and privacy concerns associated with
    your machine For example, how do you ensure sensitive training data stored in Google Cloud is properly secured, do
    you considerde-identification
- add code snippets for data exploration and feature engineering (? nicht sicher, ob die wirklich ins paper müssen) to
    whitepaper
- evtl. nochmal Abgleich mit google ml best practices
- add Paragraph machine learning model training and development
- add Paragraph machine learning model evaluation
- demonstration of how the served model can be used to make a prediction via an api call
- evidence must include a demonstration that the deployed model is fully functional after an appropriate code
    modification as might be performed by a customer
- clean code, repo, buckets etc
- potentially update figures
- add rights that have manually been granted to roles in terraform
- prepare tables for training and testing without limit#
- export jsonl file for evaluation manually
- train model properly
- add description of evaluation to paper
- distribution, device usage, and monitoring
